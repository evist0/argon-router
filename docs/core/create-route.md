# createRoute

Creates new route. Has required parameter `path`

### Basic example

```ts
import { createRoute } from '@argon-router/core';

const route = createRoute({ path: '/route' });

route.open();
```

### In-route path params

You can specify params in route path and argon-router outputs type in route object generic by `typed-url-params` library. [Learn more about syntax](https://github.com/movpushmov/argon-router/tree/main/packages/argon-router-paths)

```ts
import { createRoute } from '@argon-router/core';

const postRoute = createRoute({ path: '/post/:id' });
//       ^- Route<{ id: string }>
```

### Parent paths

Sometimes you want to nest `path` parts and `beforeOpen` effects from some routes. You can do this easily with `parent` routes:

```ts
import { createRoute } from '@argon-router/core';

const profile = createRoute({ path: '/profile/:id', beforeOpen: [] });

const friends = createRoute({ path: '/friends', parent: profile });
const posts = createRoute({ path: '/posts', parent: profile });

posts.open(); // profile.$isOpened -> true, posts.$isOpened -> true
```
